Jingle bells, jingle bells,

Jingle all the way!

O what fun it is to ride

In a one-horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells,

Jingle all the way!

O what fun it is to ride

In a one-horse open sleigh


A day or two ago,

I thought Iâ€™d take a ride,

And soon Miss Fanny Bright

Was seated by my side;

The horse was lean and lank;

Misfortune seemed his lot;

He got into a drifted bank,

And we, we got upset. O


Jingle bells, jingle bells,

Jingle all the way!

O what fun it is to ride

In a one-horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells,

Jingle all the way!

O what fun it is to ride

In a one-horse open sleigh

la la la
